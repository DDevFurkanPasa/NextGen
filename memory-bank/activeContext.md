# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing Memory Bank structure and awaiting project design document.

## Next Steps
1. Receive project design text from user
2. Populate `projectbrief.md` with core requirements and goals
3. Populate `productContext.md` with user problems and experience goals
4. Define initial system architecture in `systemPatterns.md`
5. Document technology stack in `techContext.md`

## Active Decisions
- Created Memory Bank structure following AGENTS.md specification
- All core files initialized with placeholder content
- Ready to receive project design information

## Learnings & Patterns
- Memory Bank follows hierarchical structure: projectbrief → productContext/systemPatterns/techContext → activeContext → progress
- Documentation-first approach: update files before and after task execution
- Log triage protocol requires checking terminal.log after every execution

## Blockers
None. Awaiting project design input from user.
